# Edinor Junior - Machine Learning Engineer

I'm an enthusiast of the new techs, since 2014 when I created my first startup, called GoTalent, I begin to learning about big data and how the Machine Learning Algorithms could be modeling the society. 

So, for the last six years I have come to study and work with data, specially with Python to analyze and create Machine Learning models. Feel free to follow me and add my contact.

Best Regards! 

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, R, Big Data and Neural Network.
